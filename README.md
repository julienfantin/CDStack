# CDStack
> Simplified CoreData stack management


## Rationale
CDStack aims to make it easy to use a simple CoreData configuration, and easier to manage complex setups with possibly asynchronous data stores.

What's commonly described as a CoreData stack usually refers to an instance of `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator`, its configuration and related objects.

The boilerplate generated by Xcode's CoreData template can be replaced with the following.

```objective-c
@interface MyAppDelegate
@property (strong, nonatomic) CDStack *stack;
@end
@implementation CDAppDelegate
@synthesize stack = _stack;
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
	self.stack = [[CDStack alloc] initWithStoreClass:[CDSQLiteStore class]];
    // init app
	return YES;
}
  ```

The details of this particular stack are defined on `CDSQLiteStore` which adopts the `CDPersistentStore` prorocol and makes for a designated place to define these implementation details.

```objective-c
@protocol CDPersistentStore <NSObject>
@required
+ (NSString *)type;
@optional
+ (NSURL *)url;
+ (NSString *)configuration;
+ (NSDictionary *)options;
@end
 ```

## To document
- Threading
  - Block-based fetching API for non-blocking operations
  - Background fetches and saves using Grand Central Dispatch
  - Automatically handle `NSManagedObjectContext` thread confinment
- UI-friendly fetching with GCD
